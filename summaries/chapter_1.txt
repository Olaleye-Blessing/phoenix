Migrations
Before your application can work with a database table, your migrations will need to be run to ensure that the database table exists, has the right structure for the data youâ€™ll put in it, and has the right set of indexes for performance.

Migration files allow us to build key changes to the database into code. Executing the files makes these changes to your database. Since these files need to be executed in a specific order, the filename should begin with a timestamp. You can, and likely will, build your own custom migration files, and/or customize generated migration files.
